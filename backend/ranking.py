"""
Mesh Complementarity Ranking Engine.

Given a user and a pool of candidate builders, score and order the swipe deck by
how likely each pairing is to become a productive collaboration — optimizing for
COMPLEMENTARITY (gap-filling skills), not similarity.

Score per candidate:
    score = W_COMPLEMENT * complement_fit   # their strengths fill my gaps,
            + W_RECIPROCITY * reciprocity    #   gated by shared ground
            + W_AFFINITY    * affinity        # my learned taste (updates as I swipe)
Then a diversity pass demotes near-duplicate archetypes so the deck stays varied.

All math is pure Python over unit-normalized vectors (cosine == dot product), so
the live endpoint has no heavyweight ML dependency — embeddings are precomputed
offline by embed_skills.py and just read from the DB.
